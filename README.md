Overview
The mini transformer project implements a simplified transformer language model that learns to predict the next token in a sequence. It is designed for educational purposes and as a portfolio piece to demonstrate proficiency in using JAX and Flax for state-of-the-art deep learning research.

Key Objectives:

Build a transformer model from scratch using Flax.
Train the model on a small corpus.
Generate text using the trained model.
Provide well-documented code and explanations for developers.
Features
Transformer Architecture:
Implements token embedding, sinusoidal positional encoding, multi-head self-attention, feed-forward layers, residual connections, and layer normalization.

Training Pipeline:
A full training loop using a cross-entropy loss function and the Adam optimizer with Optax.

Text Generation:
A function to generate text from a seed string using greedy sampling.

Educational Value:
Clear and modular code, designed for easy understanding and further experimentation.

Usage
Training the Model
Run the main Python script to start training. The script will:

Load a small corpus.
Tokenize the text and build a vocabulary.
Build and initialize the transformer model.
Train the model for a number of epochs while printing the training loss every 100 epochs.
bash
Copy
Edit
python transformer_text_generation.py
Expected Output:

Starting training...
Epoch 0, Loss: 3.2456
Epoch 100, Loss: 2.9874
...
Text Generation
After training, the script will generate text from a given seed (e.g., "hello"). The generated text is printed to the console.

Example:

Generated text:
hello world! hello jax! hello flax! hello world! hello jax! hello flax! ...
How It Works
Data Preparation:

A small corpus is defined as a string.
Unique characters are extracted to build the vocabulary.
The corpus is converted into a sequence of integer tokens.
Model Definition:

Embedding Layer: Converts token indices into dense vectors.
Positional Encoding: Uses a fixed sinusoidal function to generate positional encodings that are added to the embeddings.
Transformer Blocks:
Each block consists of:
Multi-head self-attention layer that allows the model to consider all tokens in the sequence.
Feed-forward network that processes the output of the attention layer.
Residual connections and layer normalization to stabilize training.
Final Projection: A dense layer that maps the final transformer output to logits corresponding to each token in the vocabulary.
Training:

A cross-entropy loss function is used to compare the model’s predictions with the actual next tokens.
The Adam optimizer (via Optax) updates the model parameters.
A training loop iterates over batches of sequences, printing the loss periodically.
Text Generation:

Starting from a seed text, the model predicts the next token.
The predicted token is appended to the input sequence, and the process is repeated to generate a longer text.
Examples
Example 1: Training on a Simple Corpus
Input:
"hello world! hello jax! hello flax! "
Process:
The model learns to predict the next character based on the context.
Output:
The training loop prints the loss, and after sufficient training, the text generation function produces coherent text that mimics the style of the input.
Example 2: Text Generation
Seed Text:
"hello"
Generated Output:
"hello world! hello jax! hello flax! hello world! hello jax! hello flax! ..."
These examples show that the model learns patterns from the input text and can generate similar text sequences.

Future Improvements
Model Scaling: Experiment with larger architectures or deeper transformer stacks.
Advanced Sampling: Implement alternative sampling methods such as top‑k or nucleus sampling for more diverse text generation.
Dataset Expansion: Train on larger and more complex datasets to improve text coherence.
Interactive Notebooks: Convert this script into Jupyter notebooks with interactive visualizations of training curves and attention weights.
